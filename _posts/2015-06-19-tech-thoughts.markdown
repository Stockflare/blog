Quote from [Bernard Baruch](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Bernard_Baruch), legendary US financier.

> During my eighty-seven years I have witnessed a whole succession of technological revolutions. But none of them has done away with the need for character in the individual or the ability to think.

50 years later, it's just as important to think about the value of the technology, not just the revolution it creates!
