## A complex minefield

To the average Joe, like me, the world of stock trading is an impenetrable, complex minefield. Filled with countless statistics, mind-boggling ratios and deafening noise. 

Then of course, there comes a time when you actually need to think about your pension pot. Do you open a brokerage account to trade with? Good luck! Welcome to the world of hefty fees and commissions. 

Trading doesn't exactly look like a trip to Disneyland, right? Perhaps that's why so many people leave their money with a robo-advisor or in an investment fund, managed by a famous brand like Fidelity or Scottish Widows.

## But if you remove the noise?

So let's imagine for a moment, you remove all the crap, all the mind-boggling charts and data, CFDs, Futures, gold, the FX market. Lord have mercy! 

Let's reduce stock trading to its most basic form. What do you end up with? Stocks, that have an ever-changing value, where the goal is very simple, "buy low, wait, sell higher". If you're still with me, perhaps we're on to something.

## Thinking back to my childhood

Remember trading playing cards back in high school with your friends? Top-trumps, football players, animals, trucks, etc. Fun, right? Perhaps you traded your cola for an David Beckham card, and sold it for a muffin. The value of Beckham's card changed. You traded low and sold higher.

So now you're all grown up, you've gotten too fat to want another muffin. But with age comes wisdom, for some of us at least, and lots of experience. You've figured out that it would be nice to actually have money when you retire, or to send those little rascals off to college. 

So let's re-visit the playing cards again, and instead of trading over lunch, you're investing over several years. 
>"Slowly, slowly catchee monkey" as the old colonial was told by the wise local.

Surely that would be fun, right? To buy a playing card at a lower price, and sell it on several years later for a much higher price. We're all adults here, money is goooood, more must be better.

## Investing like you traded

Right, we've established that trading could be fun. But how to pick? How do you know David Beckham is any good in the first place? If you picked wrong back in high school, you could have traded your cola away, only to get a mouldy banana in return! 

*Stats* of course. Playing cards had stats - the better the stats, the better the card. Stocks have "stats" too, but unlike the playing cards, they make my brain hurt trying to figure them out. What if stocks could have easy-to-understand stats like the playing cards?

Boom. Check  out Stockflare's stats on [Apple](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/AAPL.O), or how about [Microsoft](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/MSFT.O), even [Netflix](https://stockflare.com/#stocks/NFLX.O). Stockflare takes data from Thomson Reuters (they're super important, powering all the major banks); performs all of the analysis the professionals do, with some helpful analyses of our own, then break it down for you so anyone, even my gramps could understand what he's looking at ... you know, if he owned a computer.

## Finding the fun

Isn't it pretty? No bullshit noise, no head-cracking charts or impenetrable information. Investing is fun when we understand the stats.

So now, I know David Beckham is a good card, I've eagerly traded him for my cola like an excited princess, and I'm waiting to trade up for that Aston Martin. What if Beckham decides to pursue a career in the ballet while I own him? Aside from that being hilarious, his value would surely decrease. 

Wouldn't it be nice to quickly see how your stocks are doing? Set up a [Watchlist](https://stockflare.com/watchlist), baby. You watch a stock, Stockflare will provide an at-a-glance look at how its performing, so you're more likely to end up with the Aston Martin than the mouldy banana.

## No one's forcing you to play

Of course, let's not forget here, you didn't have to trade cards with your school friends. When it comes to investing, you can always save with a mutual fund or robo-advisor. But you'll find when it comes to cashing in, all you an afford is a Prius with a custom paint job. 

I don't know about you, but I'd prefer to spend a little time armed with the right tools, making the best decisions myself, trading up, with the best set of playing cards (Go Charizard!)

> Danger Will Robinson! Danger! 

Investing takes more effort than letting some robot do it for you. But that's why it's rewarding and can be fun. There will always be trades that you win and some that you lose. The key is to be armed with the right information and tools, so that you can make the right investment (who'd want to trade for Ronaldo anyway?) 

This our mission at Stockflare, to arm you and me, the average Joe, with tools the professionals envy, for free.

So visit Stockflare, find some great stocks today, watch them, and see what happens - earn those bragging rights. Let's make investing obvious to everyone. 

Go on, do it.
