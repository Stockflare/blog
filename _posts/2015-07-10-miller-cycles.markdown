Quote from [Bill Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Miller_(finance)).

> Some things never change in the investment business. They cycles of greed and fear, of undervaluation and overvaluation, have persisted as long as there have been markets.

Our own psychology is as important as the fundamentals of the businesses we invest in!
