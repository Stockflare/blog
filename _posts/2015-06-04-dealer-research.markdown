Quote from [Jim Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rogers).

> People spend more time doing research on which car to buy than they do on which stock to buy.

A little harsh as comparisons go, since we love our cars & spend so much time in them. But we should love the stocks we buy too!

Do you have a favourite quote from a famous investor or stock market pundit? We'd love to hear it.
