It's been an exciting 2014 with Stockflare launching at the end of September and hitting a monthly user figure of over 32,000 users in December. 

Here's what the last 3 months looked like. These are the user figures for each month. So nice reviews at [ProductHunt](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/stockflare), [DesignerNews](https://news.layervault.com/stories/40122-site-design-stockflares-new-landing-page), [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/best-websites/stockflare/) and especially at [LifeHacker](http://twocents.lifehacker.com/stockflare-simplifies-stock-market-data-to-make-investi-1672035079) helped us reach new users.

Better still, if we look at the underlying statistics, in terms of sessions and pageviews we are really happy that:

* Sessions are growing faster than users
* Page views per session is growing
* Time of the site is growing
* And the bounce rate has declined dramatically

The amazing cut in the bounce rate, is entirely driven by our [new landing page](https://stockflare.com/#landing). Please check it out and let us know what you think.
